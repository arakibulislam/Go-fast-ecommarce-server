This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

I am using Reactjs for the front-end and Mongodb/heroku for the back-end. The styling part will be done using CSS and BootStrap while the functionality will be added using JavaScript. We plan on making it as user-friendly as possible, with preplanned packages and even custom packages available which user can choose according to his preference.

# Hosting 
# Use Mongodb
For server hosting use HeroKu # https://git.heroku.com/intense-sierra-15995.git
